# Bootstrapper

**Build your own AI-powered development environment from scratch.**

Bootstrapper is a hands-on course that teaches you to create a portable, AI-agnostic development environment using plain English instruction files. The tools you build will work with any AI coding assistant (Claude Code, Aider, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, etc.).

## Why Bootstrapper?

- **Learn by building**: Create real tools you'll actually use
- **Environment agnostic**: Not locked into any single AI platform
- **Plain English**: No vendor-specific APIs or features
- **Incremental**: Each workshop builds on the previous
